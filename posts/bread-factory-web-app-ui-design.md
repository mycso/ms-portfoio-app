I aimed to design UI elements and the visuals that are super clean, minimal and attractive. I focused on getting rid of anything that doesn't serve a purpose or improve the user experience in some way. Minimal design doesn't mean it looks boring. 

I didn't want to overwhelm users with too much information scattered all over the site because The Bread Factory had a lot to offer their clients. By effectively utilizing certain clear and white spaces to organize information clearly and displaying beautiful visual designs, I was able to produce a clean and attractive website.
