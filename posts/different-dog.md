# Different Dog

*Different Dog is a website that I designed with a team for a healthy dog and pet food and accessories e-commerce business who set out to prove that hand-cooking food with real ingredients would change dogsâ€™ lives. Since day one, customers have been telling us that after our food, their dog is a different dog. The website features a Menu with all the items and their ingredients on it so you can get an idea of what was offered. 

The Different Dog was designed to be appealing and informative for prospective users before the web app release, informing them about what to anticipate and encouraging them to search, sign up for the to help provide the best health for your dog and stay connected. I focused on making it simple for site visitors to discover what they need and join the queue easily by placing CTAs effectively both in the home banner and above the footer. 

Fresh dog food, made with 100% British meat, delivered to your door Nutritionist-designed recipes, with no grains, legumes or nasties. Fussy dog approved, we even guarantee empty bowls and positive news when taking dog to the vet. Access to our in-house vet and pet nutritionist for free advice to bring the best out of your pets. 

As the company is growing fast, it was important to build a design system at scale so that it will constantly evolve and develop with an ease of use and maintenance. The design system has of a style guide and UI components such as typography, colors, grid systems, icons, buttons, checkboxes, profiles, UI cards, navigation and footers, and so on. I ensured that the process of building the website throughout the design and frontend development is carried out swiftly and efficiently with this design system. With documentation of the css, interaction and use of the components for the developers, I also made sure that the delivery of UI Design would be faster and the end result as similar to the design as possible.*
