The corporate website application and product configurator were a big part of the whole redesign of the user experience. I was responsible for the whole redesign of their website and design system, from the wireframe to the final specifications to the developers. Besides their website, I led the design of the product configurator and the development of a hi-fi prototype. 

I was involved in the rebranding process, I curated the guidelines regarding the online channel and created the animation showing the evolution of the logo. Other Information: The idea behind FSI FM HR was built from an open source application that uses widgets and other UI features that will allow clients to build end to end application This is know as Dreamscapes Widgets.
