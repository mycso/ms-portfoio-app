Grants Payment is a new payment system with a sleek UI design. It is built with React.js components and the latest frontend enterprise technology. It has been designed it to make it as easy as possible for you to use! In this case study I had to help an epos system selling company that wanted to update their website. I started by researching their competitors to be able to create a new look for their site from scratch which will stand out. 

The client was looking for something that has a professional design that would attract more customers. My role for this project was to create a good web experience for their audience by using my design skills and research. They were pleased with the results and I am current working on the frontend development of this website.
