The idea behind Oak & Co was to build an open source Property management and development application in React.js Story Book UI components library to help developers to create high quality entreprise application. With that in mind, we also want the components to be easily integrated and customized to match any existing application without messing with existing styles. The client wanted to update their website, so I worked on creating a new look from scratch. 

The client was looking for something that has a professional design that would attract more customers. My role for this project for a property management company was to design a website that achieved their goals of providing a good experience for their customers. After the project ended, the client was extremely satisfied with the results and they were very happy with their new website to go on to the developer team to be built.
