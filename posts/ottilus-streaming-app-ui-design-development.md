Ottilus Streaming App is your reliable streaming application solutions, and it is now also perceived as such from the outside. For this project, I was involved in the design of some parts of the website and mobile app (i.e. the navigation, the featured page/home page, the footer, the contact page, the search page, the favourites page, the streaming player) and the detailing of specifications for the developers. I was involved in the rebranding process, I curated the guidelines regarding the online channel and created the animation showing the evolution of the Ottilus's logo. 

This project is part of a teamwork at Sintec Media Group. Other Information: The idea behind Ottilus Streaming App was to build an open source TV on-demand application in AngularJS and Handlebars.js within our MVC Zend Framework to help my fellow backend developers to create high quality entreprise application. With that in mind, we also want the components to be easily integrated and customized to match any existing application without messing with existing styles.
