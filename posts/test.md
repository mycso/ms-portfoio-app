The Wine Society is an online wine-buying club for avid wine drinkers. The website is powered by the Optimizely Digital Experience and offers a personalised experience for each customer. The company's site was in need of an update, and the design had to be completely overhauled as the overall UX and UI design necessitated a significant amount of effort. 

It is because it didn't aim to solve users' problems or it wasn't built with a design system that would ensure managing design at scale using reusable, systemized and cohesive components and styles. As the project has been developed finished and the design system is fully created you can now see the finished site by clicking the link below.
