# So Who Am I?
            
A Creative Coder and UI designer or a special unicorn hybrid lol! I am always willing to learn and not afraid to try new things. 
I enjoy participating in groups creating multimedia elements and designing interfaces and progamming using different 
design software. I have high knowledge building and designing single page applications and traditional 
page applications. With the initial skillset of UI/UX designing the look and experience of the software 
applications and coding with languages such as HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 3.0, ReactJS, Angular 
JS, NodeJs, Vanilla Javascript, Jquery, Wordpress, Figma, PhotoShop, Invision, Zeplin.io and After Effects etc.

I am a very hard working man when it comes to work or anything that involves or appeals to the basis of responsibility. 
I have the desire to succeed in everything I do putting in 100%. I am target driven and very 
direct therefore I like to deliver when I have been set a task. I always aim for the best within 
me and the people I work with. I thrive on challenges, and I am always looking to exceed my 
previous success. My main goal is to become an individual who works amongst people in an 
innovative and creative environment and also has the skillset of a backend developer.
