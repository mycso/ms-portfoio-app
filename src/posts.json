Since day one, customers have been telling us that after our food, their dog is a different dog. The website features a Menu with all the items and their ingredients on it so you can get an idea of what was offered. The Different Dog was designed to be appealing and informative for prospective users before the web app release, informing them about what to anticipate and encouraging them to search, sign up for the to help provide the best health for your dog and stay connected.

The design system has of a style guide and UI components such as typography, colors, grid systems, icons, buttons, checkboxes, profiles, UI cards, navigation and footers, and so on.
