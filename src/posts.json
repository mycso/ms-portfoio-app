The client wanted to update their website, so I worked on creating a new look from scratch. \r\n\r\nThe client was looking for something that has a professional design that would attract more customers. My role for this project for a property management company was to design a website that achieved their goals of providing a good experience for their customers.

The design system has of a style guide and UI components such as typography, colors, grid systems, icons, buttons, checkboxes, profiles, UI cards, navigation and footers, and so on.

With documentation of the css, interaction and use of the components for the developers, I also made sure that the delivery of UI Design would be faster and the end result as similar to the design as possible.*\r\n"
